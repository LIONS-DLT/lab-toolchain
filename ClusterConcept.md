# Concept for a Modular Research Scenario Private Blockchain Platform

## Introduction

As part of the Project LIONS [Ledger Innovation and Operation Network for Sovereignty](https://www.unibw.de/lions) we plan to offer a managed permission Blockchain platform (some may describe it as Blockchain-as-a-Service) targeted specifically at research groups or institutions. The main idea is this: Focus on the value and create your smart contracts, tokens and blockchain-enabled applications and use our infrastructure and provisioning mechanisms to experiment with different network sizes and configurations.

A specific challenge for industry and research groups alike is that they do not have the required time and know-how to operate a Hyperledger Fabric platform. This usually means that one has to use cloud services (e.g. Amazon AWS, IBM Blockchain Platform, Microsoft Azure etc.) to setup their configurations. This is usually relatively easy, however there are still risks and limitations: Machine Sizes are predefined, there is little (or no) bandwidth or latency control - to use for stress tests and so on. Guidance for scaling and fine tuning the Fabric platform itself is scarce and usually not the research focus. For those who do have this focus we also plan to offer a parameterized setup for larger scale performance tests.
